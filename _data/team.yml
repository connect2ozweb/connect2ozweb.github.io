  bio: >-
    Gold medallist, high scorer, multi-faceted, efficient and hardworking
    individual with experience in content writing and video editing. My past
    experiences include working as a video editor and script writer for channel31
    Melbourne for over 3 months, filming many forms of media including live
    broadcasts, internet content, educational videos, and much more. I have also
    filmed and edited few news pieces for burn TV, Melbourne. I have been a part of
    connect2ozweb since its natal stage; as its content writer and editor.
    Being a student at Swinburne University I have created several videos that
    have been seen by thousands of viewers over various social media platforms.
    I have worked as a freelancer at various places and for multiple clients
    ranging from interview recordings, educational videos and other material. I
    have also worked as a researcher which I feel has enhanced and honed my
    communication skills. I am passionate about creative arts hence I am
    currently pursuing a course in English Literature to help me be more
    analytical, intense yet detached.
    I am also fond of slogan writing, particularly for Ads and images. I feel a
    tinge of novelty and creativity makes a work stand out. In a world of
    plagiarism, be an author of a work that is not a copy but worth copying.
